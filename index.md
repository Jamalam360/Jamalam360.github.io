## Welcome to 

 I'm using this as a place to keep a record of some of the cool projects I've done. 
You can find me elsewhere:
- On Discord at [my discord server](https://discord.gg/MqXWZaKUvp)
- On GitHub at [my personal profile](https://github.com/Jamalam360) or [my modding organisation](https://github.com/JamCoreModding)

With that said, here are some cool things I've made:
- Reaping Mod:
	Allows you to 'reap' animals to get food
    ![reapers.png]({{site.baseurl}}/img/reapers.png)
- RightClickHarvest:
	Lets you right click to harvest crops
- SocksEnchantments:
	A mod I made for the YouTuber SocksFor1 that adds loads of new enchantments
	![withers.png]({{site.baseurl}}/img/withers.png)
- EntityScaling:
	A mod I made for the YouTuber RedFox that scales entities down when you hit 	them, or up when they heal
- Workshop:
	A WIP Vanilla+ tech mod created in collaboration with 2 other modders
- Loads of other smaller mods not worth mentioning here
I've also created lots more random, non MineCraft related projects like Discord bots.

If you want to reach out to me about commissioning a mod, please speak directly to me on discord @jamalam#0001.
