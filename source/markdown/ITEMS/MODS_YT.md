I've created many Minecraft mods for YouTubers, primarily
[_SocksFor1_](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsEgeyBfOnGGBpjIvkDJbWg) and
[_RedFox_](https://www.youtube.com/c/RedFoxYT). This involves being given a
rough idea and developing it myself to create a fun and engaging mod for a
video. It also involves working with other people such as texturers or modelers.
