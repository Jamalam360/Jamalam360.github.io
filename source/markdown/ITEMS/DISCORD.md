I have created a variety of Discord bots that help users and moderators while
they are using Discord. You can find all of my Discord bots on
[_GitHub_](https://github.com/JamCoreDiscord) - the most notable one being
[_Pinguino_](https://github.com/JamCoreDiscord/Pinguino). I have also worked on
[_Cozy_](https://github.com/QuiltMC/cozy-discord) for QuiltMC's community
tooling team.
