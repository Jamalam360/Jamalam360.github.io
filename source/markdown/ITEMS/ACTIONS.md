I am proficient in GitHub Actions, using it to automatically update my
dependencies, find errors in my code, apply check styles and automate my project
dependencies. Most notably, I have created a system to automatically deploy
[_Pinguino_](https://github.com/JamCoreDiscord/Pinguino) to my VPS when an
update is pushed to GitHub.
