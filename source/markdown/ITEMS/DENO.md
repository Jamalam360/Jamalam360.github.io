I work with the [_Deno_](https://deno.land) runtime using TypeScript. Some
projects I have created include:
[Discord GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Jamalam360/DiscordGitHubReleases),
[dog.jamalam.tech](https://github.com/dog-jamalam-tech), an
[implementation of Bloom filters](https://github.com/Jamalam360/bloom), a
[Link Shortener](https://link.jamalam.tech), a
[website to track companies that support NFTs](https://nft.jamalam.tech), a
[Discord webhook library](https://deno.land/x/dishooks), a
[script](https://github.com/Jamalam360/river-level-checker) that checks the
height of a river to see whether it is low enough to row on, every morning. In
addition, this website itself is 'compiled' using Deno - what you are reading
right now was originally a Markdown file that has been substituded into HTML by
my build-script. It also formats the HTML, and runs every time I push to GitHub.
I've also have picked up some NGINX server skills from deploying all of my
projects to my VPS.
