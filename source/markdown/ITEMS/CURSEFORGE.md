I've created an array of Minecraft mods that add anything from simple blocks to
an entire custom 'jam' creation system. Through this, I've gained over 500,000
downloads on CurseForge. You can find all my mods at
[_CurseForge_](https://www.curseforge.com/members/jamalam360/) or
[_GitHub_](https://github.com/JamCoreModding). I also work with other people on
my mods for textures, assets and code.
