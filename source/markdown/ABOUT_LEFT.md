I have been a developer since 2016, starting off with Python and C#, but now
primarily working in Java, Kotlin and JS/TS to create things that interest me
such as Minecraft mods (using the S[Quilt](https://quiltmc.org) toolchain),
S[Discord](https://discord.gg) bots (using Kotlin and
S[Kordex](https://github.com/Kord-Extensions/kord-extensions)) and webpages/APIs
usually using S[Deno](https://deno.land/) and S[Aleph](https://alephjs.org/).
